    <string name="rules">Nasi lemak is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf.
        It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish.[7][8][9]
        It is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore,[10] Brunei, and Southern Thailand.
        In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra, especially the Malay regions of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan.[11]
        Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, prepared by Filipino Moros,
        as well as Australia\'s external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
        It is considered an essential dish for a typical Malay-style breakfast.
        Nasi lemak is featured as a national dish in most of the countryâ€™s tourism brochures and promotional materials.
        It is not to be confused with nasi dagang,
        sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan (and its kindred region in Pattani,
        Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand and Natuna in Indonesia), although both dishes are often served for breakfast.
        However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day.</string>
